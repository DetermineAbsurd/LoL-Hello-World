# Needs Compilation
This is rather self-explanatory. You can't just double click the file to run it. The code needs to be compiled in their respective compilers. I have not included how to do this, but a simple Google search will help you with each language.

# Scripts
These should run via double clicking or right clicking and selecting run with each script. They do not need compiling because they either interpret on the fly or JIT/Compile on their own before running. You might need the language installed beforehand, depending on your Operating System.
