# Lots of Languages: "Hello World"

The whole point of this is to say "Hello, World!" to a console, or another similar medium, in as many languages as possible. I guess it is just for the heck of it. It doesn't really have a purpose other than seeing how many languages I can find and to make a rainbow at the top of the repo.

Most of the Hello World scripts/applications come from the websites main page or their respective Wikipedia pages.

I started this around Mid 2016, so I have no honest idea where I got some of these from. I claim that none of them are mine and I do not infer that they belong to myself. The only scripts that I know how to say "Hello, World!" in are Python 2/3, ShellScript and Batch, because those are the only languages I actually know at the time of writing this (July 1st, 2017).
