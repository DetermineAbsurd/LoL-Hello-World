# Lots of Languages: "Hello World"

The whole point of this is to say "Hello, World!" to a console, or another
similar medium, in as many languages as possible. I guess it is just for the
heck of it. It doesn't really have a purpose other than seeing how many
languages I can find while attempting to make a rainbow at the top of the repo.

Most of the Hello World scripts/applications come from the websites main page
or their respective Wikipedia pages.
